Implements a pure proleptic Gregorian calendar system, which defines every
 * fourth year as leap, unless the year is divisible by 100 and not by 400.
 * This improves upon the Julian calendar leap year rule.
 * <p>
 * Although the Gregorian calendar did not exist before 1582 CE, this
 * chronology assumes it did, thus it is proleptic. This implementation also
 * fixes the start of the year at January 1, and defines the year zero.
 * <p>
 * GregorianChronology is thread-safe and immutable.
