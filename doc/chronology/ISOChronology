Implements a chronology that follows the rules of the ISO8601 standard,
 * which is compatible with Gregorian for all modern dates.
 * When ISO does not define a field, but it can be determined (such as AM/PM)
 * it is included.
 * <p>
 * With the exception of century related fields, ISOChronology is exactly the
 * same as {@link GregorianChronology}. In this chronology, centuries and year
 * of century are zero based. For all years, the century is determined by
 * dropping the last two digits of the year, ignoring sign. The year of century
 * is the value of the last two year digits.
 * <p>
 * ISOChronology is thread-safe and immutable.
