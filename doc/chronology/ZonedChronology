static boolean useTimeArithmetic(DurationField misc.field):
Use time of day arithmetic rules for unit durations less than typical time zone offsets.

static class ZonedDurationField extends BaseDurationField :
 Because time durations are typically smaller than time zone offsets, the
     * arithmetic methods subtract the original offset. This produces a more
     * expected behavior when crossing time zone offset transitions. For dates,
     * the new offset is subtracted off. This behavior, if applied to time
     * fields, can nullify or reverse an add when crossing a transition.
