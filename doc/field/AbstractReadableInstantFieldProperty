AbstractReadableInstantFieldProperty is a base class for binding a
 * ReadableInstant to a DateTimeField.
 * <p>
 * It allows the date and time manipulation code to be field based yet
 * still easy to use.
 * <p>
 * AbstractReadableInstantFieldProperty itself is thread-safe and immutable,
 * but the ReadableInstant being operated on may be mutable and not
 * thread-safe.

public int get():
Gets the value of this property from the instant.
     * <p>
     * For example, the following two lines of code are equivalent:
     * <pre>
     * datetime.getDayOfMonth();
     * datetime.dayOfMonth().get();
     * </pre>
     *
     * @return the current value
     * @see DateTimeField#get

public String getAsString():
Gets the value of this property from the instant as a string.
     * <p>
     * This method returns the value converted to a <code>String</code>
     * using <code>Integer.toString</code>. This method does NOT return
     * textual descriptions such as 'Monday' or 'January'.
     * See {@link #getAsText()} and {@link #getAsShortText()} for those.
     *
     * @return the current value
     * @see DateTimeField#get

public String getAsText():
Gets the textual value of this property from the instant as a
     * string in the default locale.
     * <p>
     * This method returns the value converted to a <code>String</code>
     * returning the appropriate textual description wherever possible.
     * Thus, a day of week of 1 would return 'Monday' in English.
     *
     * @return the current text value
     * @see DateTimeField#getAsText
