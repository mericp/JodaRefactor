<code>DecoratedDateTimeField</code> extends {@link BaseDateTimeField},
 * implementing only the minimum required set of methods. These implemented
 * methods delegate to a wrapped misc.field.
 * <p>
 * This design allows new DateTimeField types to be defined that piggyback on
 * top of another, inheriting all the safe method implementations from
 * BaseDateTimeField. Should any method require pure delegation to the
 * wrapped misc.field, simply override and use the provided getWrappedField method.
 * <p>
 * DecoratedDateTimeField is thread-safe and immutable, and its subclasses must
 * be as well.
