LocalDate is an immutable datetime class representing a date
 * without a time zone.
 * <p>
 * LocalDate implements the {@link ReadablePartial} interface.
 * To do this, the interface methods focus on the key fields -
 * Year, MonthOfYear and DayOfMonth.
 * However, <b>all</b> date fields may in fact be queried.
 * <p>
 * LocalDate differs from DateMidnight in that this class does not
 * have a time zone and does not represent a single instant in time.
 * <p>
 * Calculations on LocalDate are performed using a {@link chronology}.
 * This chronology will be set internally to be in the UTC time zone
 * for all calculations.
 *
 * <p>Each individual field can be queried in two ways:
 * <ul>
 * <li><code>getMonthOfYear()</code>
 * <li><code>monthOfYear().get()</code>
 * </ul>
 * The second technique also provides access to other useful methods on the
 * field:
 * <ul>
 * <li>numeric value
 * <li>text value
 * <li>short text value
 * <li>maximum/minimum values
 * <li>add/subtract
 * <li>set
 * <li>rounding
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>
 * LocalDate is thread-safe and immutable, provided that the Chronology is as well.
 * All standard Chronology classes supplied are thread-safe and immutable.

 public static LocalDate now():
 Obtains a {@code LocalDate} set to the current system millisecond time
      * using <code>ISOChronology</code> in the default time zone.
      *
      * @return the current date-time, not null

public static LocalDate now(DateTimeZone zone):
Obtains a {@code LocalDate} set to the current system millisecond time
     * using <code>ISOChronology</code> in the specified time zone.
     *
     * @param zone  the time zone, not null
     * @return the current date-time, not null

public static LocalDate now(Chronology chronology):
Obtains a {@code LocalDate} set to the current system millisecond time
     * using the specified chronology.
     *
     * @param chronology  the chronology, not null
     * @return the current date-time, not null

public static LocalDate parse(String str):
Parses a {@code LocalDate} from the specified string.
     * <p>
     * This uses {@link ISODateTimeFormat#localDateParser()}.
     *
     * @param str  the string to parse, not null

public static LocalDate parse(String str, DateTimeFormatter formatter):
Parses a {@code LocalDate} from the specified string using a formatter.
     *
     * @param str  the string to parse, not null
     * @param formatter  the formatter to use, not null

public static LocalDate fromCalendarFields(Calendar calendar):
Constructs a LocalDate from a <code>java.util.Calendar</code>
     * using exactly the same field values.
     * <p>
     * Each field is queried from the Calendar and assigned to the LocalDate.
     * This is useful if you have been using the Calendar as a local date,
     * ignoring the zone.
     * <p>
     * One advantage of this method is that this method is unaffected if the
     * version of the time zone data differs between the JDK and Joda-Time.
     * That is because the local field values are transferred, calculated using
     * the JDK time zone data and without using the Joda-Time time zone data.
     * <p>
     * This factory method ignores the type of the calendar and always
     * creates a LocalDate with ISO chronology. It is expected that you
     * will only pass in instances of <code>GregorianCalendar</code> however
     * this is not validated.
     *
     * @param calendar  the Calendar to extract fields from, not null
     * @return the created local date, not null
     * @throws IllegalArgumentException if the calendar is null
     * @throws IllegalArgumentException if the date is invalid for the ISO chronology

 public static LocalDate fromDateFields(Date date):
 Constructs a LocalDate from a <code>java.util.Date</code>
      * using exactly the same field values.
      * <p>
      * Each field is queried from the Date and assigned to the LocalDate.
      * This is useful if you have been using the Date as a local date,
      * ignoring the zone.
      * <p>
      * One advantage of this method is that this method is unaffected if the
      * version of the time zone data differs between the JDK and Joda-Time.
      * That is because the local field values are transferred, calculated using
      * the JDK time zone data and without using the Joda-Time time zone data.
      * <p>
      * This factory method always creates a LocalDate with ISO chronology.
      *
      * @param date  the Date to extract fields from, not null
      * @return the created local date, not null
      * @throws IllegalArgumentException if the calendar is null
      * @throws IllegalArgumentException if the date is invalid for the ISO chronology
