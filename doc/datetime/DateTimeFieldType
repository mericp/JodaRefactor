Identifies a field, such as year or minuteOfHour, in a chronology-neutral way.
<p>
A field type defines the type of the field, such as hourOfDay.
If does not directly enable any calculations, however it does provide a
{@link #getField(Chronology)} method that returns the actual calculation engine
for a particular chronology.
It also provides access to the related {@link DurationFieldType}s.
<p>
Instances of <code>DateTimeFieldType</code> are singletons.
They can be compared using <code>==</code>.
<p>
If required, you can create your own field, for example a quarterOfYear.
You must create a subclass of <code>DateTimeFieldType</code> that defines the field type.
This class returns the actual calculation engine from {@link #getField(Chronology)}.
The subclass should implement equals and hashCode.
