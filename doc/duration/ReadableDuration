Defines an exact duration of time in milliseconds.
 * <p>
 * The implementation of this interface may be mutable or immutable. This
 * interface only gives access to retrieve data, never to change it.
 * <p>
 * Methods that are passed a duration as a parameter will treat <code>null</code>
 * as a zero length duration.
 * <p>
 * The {@code compareTo} method is no longer defined in this class in version 2.0.
 * Instead, the definition is simply inherited from the {@code Comparable} interface.
 * This approach is necessary to preserve binary compatibility.
 * The definition of the comparison is ascending order by millisecond duration.
 * Implementors are recommended to extend {@code AbstractInstant} instead of this interface.

 long getMillis():
 Gets the total length of this duration in milliseconds.
      *
      * @return the total length of the time duration in milliseconds.

Duration toDuration():
Get this duration as an immutable <code>Duration</code> object.
     * <p>
     * This will either typecast this instance, or create a new <code>Duration</code>.
     *
     * @return a Duration created using the millisecond duration from this instance

Period toPeriod():
Converts this duration to a Period instance using the standard period type
     * and the ISO chronology.
     * <p>
     * Only precise fields in the period type will be used. Thus, only the hour,
     * minute, second and millisecond fields on the period will be used.
     * The year, month, week and day fields will not be populated.
     * <p>
     * If the duration is small, less than one day, then this method will perform
     * as you might expect and split the fields evenly.
     * If the duration is larger than one day then all the remaining duration will
     * be stored in the largest available field, hours in this case.
     * <p>
     * For example, a duration effectively equal to (365 + 60 + 5) days will be
     * converted to ((365 + 60 + 5) * 24) hours by this constructor.
     * <p>
     * For more control over the conversion process, you must pair the duration with
     * an instant, see {@link Period#Period(ReadableInstant,ReadableDuration)}.
     *
     * @return a Period created using the millisecond duration from this instance
