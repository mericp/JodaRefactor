Identifies a duration field, such as years or minutes, in a chronology-neutral way.
 * <p>
 * A duration field type defines the type of the field, such as hours.
 * If does not directly enable any calculations, however it does provide a
 * {@link #getField(Chronology)} method that returns the actual calculation engine
 * for a particular chronology.
 * <p>
 * Instances of <code>DurationFieldType</code> are singletons.
 * They can be compared using <code>==</code>.
 * <p>
 * If required, you can create your own field, for example a quarters.
 * You must create a subclass of <code>DurationFieldType</code> that defines the field type.
 * This class returns the actual calculation engine from {@link #getField(Chronology)}.
