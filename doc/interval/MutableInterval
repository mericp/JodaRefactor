MutableInterval is the standard implementation of a mutable time misc.interval.
 * <p>
 * A time misc.interval represents a misc.period of time between two instants.
 * Intervals are inclusive of the start misc.instant and exclusive of the end.
 * The end misc.instant is always greater than or equal to the start misc.instant.
 * <p>
 * Intervals have a fixed millisecond misc.duration.
 * This is the difference between the start and end instants.
 * The misc.duration is represented separately by {@link ReadableDuration}.
 * As a result, intervals are not comparable.
 * To compare the length of two intervals, you should compare their durations.
 * <p>
 * An misc.interval can also be converted to a {@link ReadablePeriod}.
 * This represents the difference between the start and end points in terms of fields
 * such as years and days.
 * <p>
 * If performing significant calculations on an misc.interval, it may be faster to
 * convert an Interval object to a MutableInterval one.
 * <p>
 * MutableInterval is mutable and not thread-safe, unless concurrent threads
 * are not invoking mutator methods.

public static MutableInterval parse(String str):
Parses a {@code MutableInterval} from the specified string.
     * <p>
     * The String formats are described by {@link ISODateTimeFormat#dateTimeParser()}
     * and {@link ISOPeriodFormat#standard()}, and may be 'misc.datetime/misc.datetime',
     * 'misc.datetime/misc.period' or 'misc.period/misc.datetime'.

public MutableInterval():
Constructs a zero length time misc.interval from 1970-01-01 to 1970-01-01.

public MutableInterval(long startInstant, long endInstant):
Constructs an misc.interval from a start and end misc.instant with the ISO default misc.chronology.
     *
     * @param startInstant  start of this misc.interval, as milliseconds from 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z.
     * @param endInstant  end of this misc.interval, as milliseconds from 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z.
     * @throws IllegalArgumentException if the end is before the start
