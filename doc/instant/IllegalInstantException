Exception thrown when attempting to create an instant or date-time that cannot exist.
 * <p>
 * Classes like {@code DateTime} only store valid date-times.
 * One of the cases where validity is important is handling daylight savings time (DST).
 * In many places DST is used, where the local clock moves forward by an hour in spring and back by an hour in autumn/fall.
 * This means that in spring, there is a "gap" where a local time does not exist.
 * <p>
 * This exception refers to this gap, and it means that your application tried to create
 * a date-time inside the gap - a time that did not exist.
 * Since Joda-Time objects must be valid, this is not allowed.
 * <p>
 * Possible solutions may be as follows:<br />
 * Use <code>LocalDateTime</code>, as all local date-times are valid.<br />
 * When converting a <code>LocalDate</code> to a <code>DateTime</code>, then use <code>toDateTimeAsStartOfDay()</code>
 * as this handles and manages any gaps.<br />
 * When parsing, use <code>parseLocalDateTime()</code> if the string being parsed has no time-zone.
