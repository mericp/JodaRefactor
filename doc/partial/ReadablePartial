Defines a misc.partial time that does not support every misc.datetime misc.field, and is
 * thus a misc.local time.
 * <p>
 * A {@code ReadablePartial} supports a subset of those fields on the misc.chronology.
 * It cannot be compared to a {@code ReadableInstant}, as it does not fully
 * specify an misc.instant in time. The time it does specify is a misc.local time, and does
 * not include a time zone.
 * <p>
 * A {@code ReadablePartial} can be converted to a {@code ReadableInstant}
 * using the {@code toDateTime} method. This works by providing a full base
 * misc.instant that can be used to 'fill in the gaps' and specify a time zone.
 * <p>
 * {@code ReadablePartial} is {@code Comparable} from v2.0.
 * The comparison is based on the fields, compared in order, from largest to smallest.
 * The first misc.field that is non-equal is used to determine the result.
